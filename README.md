# Language Translator Web Application

This is a web application built using Flask, Google Translate API, and `langdetect` for detecting and translating text into multiple languages. The application allows users to input text, detect its language, and translate it into a target language.

## Features

- **Language Detection**: Automatically detects the language of the input text.
- **Language Translation**: Translates the detected text into the specified target language.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and professional design for a smooth user experience.
- **Supports Multiple Languages**: The app supports numerous languages including Hindi, Telugu, Chinese, French, and many more.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Translation**: Google Translate API
- **Language Detection**: `langdetect`
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (using Bootstrap for responsiveness and style)

## Project Workflow

The project follows a straightforward development workflow to handle the core features—language detection, text translation, and display. Here's how the application works:

1. **User Input**:
    - A user visits the homepage of the web app.
    - The user inputs a block of text they want to translate into a different language.
   
2. **Language Detection**:
    - Upon form submission, the input text is passed to the language detection function.
    - The application uses `langdetect` to detect the language of the input text.
    - The detected language is displayed to the user.

3. **Translation**:
    - The application uses the Google Translate API via the `googletrans` library to translate the detected text into the user's selected target language.
    - The translation result is displayed on the page.

4. **UI/UX Display**:
    - The user interface is built using Flask’s Jinja templating engine, with the results shown dynamically on the page after processing.

5. **Error Handling**:
    - If no text is entered or if there is an error during detection or translation, proper error messages are displayed.
    
6. **Frontend Styling**:
    - Bootstrap is used for responsive and professional UI design.
    - The application uses a background image relevant to translation and positions the form in a clean, non-congested manner.
